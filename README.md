# üìò Library Database Management System

## üìå Project Overview

This project is a **Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)** built using **MySQL**.
The system models a **Library Management System** with the ability to track:

* Books
* Borrowers (Students and Teachers)
* Library Staff
* Borrow Records
* Fines for late returns

The goal of this project is to demonstrate understanding of:

* Database design principles
* Relationships (One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-Many)
* Use of constraints (`PRIMARY KEY`, `FOREIGN KEY`, `NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`)

---

## üéØ Objectives

* Design and implement a normalized relational database.
* Apply database constraints to ensure data integrity.
* Demonstrate relationships between entities in a real-world scenario.
* Provide practice data for testing queries.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Database Schema

### Entities and Relationships

* **Books** ‚Üí can be borrowed by many members.
* **Students & Teachers** ‚Üí separate tables for different borrower categories.
* **Staff** ‚Üí responsible for handling borrow and return transactions.
* **BorrowRecords** ‚Üí junction table linking Books, Borrowers, and Staff.
* **Fines** ‚Üí linked to BorrowRecords to track penalties for late returns.

### Relationships

* `Books (1) ‚Üî (M) BorrowRecords`
* `Students (1) ‚Üî (M) BorrowRecords`
* `Teachers (1) ‚Üî (M) BorrowRecords`
* `Staff (1) ‚Üî (M) BorrowRecords`
* `BorrowRecords (1) ‚Üî (1) Fines`

---

## üíª Installation & Setup

### 1. Create Database

```sql
CREATE DATABASE LibraryDB;
USE LibraryDB;
```

### 2. Run the Schema

Execute the `library_db.sql` file in MySQL:

```bash
mysql -u root -p LibraryDB < library_db.sql
```

### 3. Insert Practice Data

Run the provided `INSERT` statements to populate sample records.

---

## üìä Sample Queries

### 1. List all borrowed books with borrower details

```sql
SELECT b.title, br.borrow_date, br.return_date, br.borrower_type, 
       CASE 
         WHEN br.borrower_type = 'Student' THEN (SELECT name FROM Students WHERE student_id = br.borrower_id)
         WHEN br.borrower_type = 'Teacher' THEN (SELECT name FROM Teachers WHERE teacher_id = br.borrower_id)
       END AS borrower_name,
       s.name AS staff_name
FROM BorrowRecords br
JOIN Books b ON br.book_id = b.book_id
JOIN Staff s ON br.staff_id = s.staff_id;
```

### 2. List all fines with borrower details

```sql

       br.borrower_type, br.borrow_id, b.title
FROM Fines f
JOIN BorrowRecords br ON f.borrow_id = br.borrow_id
JOIN Books b ON br.book_id = b.book_id;
```
